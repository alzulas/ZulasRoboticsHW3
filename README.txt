My team: Just me, A. Leah Zulas

The first part of the homework is to make a square free of any external help.
This can be found in the file FreeSquare.py
It makes kind of a lame square, but it's a square. 
Trying to get the math exact is difficult, so it's close but not quite right.

The second part of the homework is to make a square using open CV and image tracking. 
This can be found in file called OpenCVSquare.py
It makes a really good square using four fire hydrants. 
It also tells you which way it thinks it is of the target.

I included the "world" files, but I could never get them to work, so I don't know how good they are.
I've tried, the one that comes straight out of the gazebo save, "squareWorld" with no success. 
I've also tried renaming it with a .world on the end, "squareWorld.world" with no success.
I've tried saving them in better locations, with no success. 
So.... good luck with the world files.


The hardest part of this asssignment was the world files. Because they never work. I worked on the problem for hours. No luck.

I use a lot of ros.org, and edu.gaitech, but no direct code this time. Also, I'm bad at python, so I got help from the official python website.
